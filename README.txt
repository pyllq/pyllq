Monarch Chinesebrowser HTML layout engine is based on Mozilla Firefox, XUL and Gecko.
Most of the browser codes are open source and are released here in compliance
with MPL 2.0.

Please refer to the App for license details.

Please note that we are not releasing the source codes for proprietary components.
(mainly libpye.so codes - this is the pinyin engine; freetype2 and harfbuzz - these are
modified and ported in from our chromium port and are not subjected to MPL).
The codes released should compile and work but without the pinyin engine components.
It may require some modifications and testing though.


You can follow Monarch Chinesebrowser modifications by following the trails provided by git.


The following is the original README text from Mozilla.
